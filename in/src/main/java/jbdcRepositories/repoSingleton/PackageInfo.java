/**
 * This package contains factory classes responsible for creating and providing instances of various repositories.
 *
 * These factory classes ensure that only one instance of each repository is created and reused for efficiency.
 * They provide access to the repositories for different data models, such as players, bank accounts, and transactions.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Use the factory classes to obtain instances of repositories for specific data models.
 * - The factory classes create the repositories only when needed and ensure that the same instance is reused throughout the application.
 * - This promotes efficient memory usage and data consistency when interacting with the underlying data storage.
